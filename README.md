# plotting

Python version: 3.7.2
Matlab version: '9.4.0.813654 (R2018a)'

The first plot in the figure shows 𝑦 = 𝑒^𝑥 function. 

In the second plot, there are two functions:

𝑦 = 𝑒^𝑥 ∗ sin 𝑥^2
𝑦 = 𝑒^𝑥 ∗ cos 𝑥^2

Notes:
1. For all 3 functions, x values should be defined in the
range of −𝜋 𝑡𝑜 + 𝜋.

2. You need to use subplot function to display multiple
plots side by side.

3. Generate the plot titles, axis labels, axis ranges,
legends, line styles and line widths as shown in the
figure.
